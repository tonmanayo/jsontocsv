WWW.SAWIP.ORG

February 22nd 2017 To whom it may concern It gives me great pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Danelle Jansen van Rensburg. I have known Danelle since March 2016 when she was selected to participate in the South Africa-Washington International Program (SAWIP). Aimed at preparing and inspiring the next generation of South African leaders through a rigorous 7-month leadership development and community engagement program in SA and Washington DC SAWIP selects students who are not only gifted but who display a commitment to building a prosperous society for all. Through her participation in SAWIP Danelle has proven herself able to work under pressure in the global arena and she is very comfortable in challenging situations that require resilience and grit. I have been in a position to observe Danelle’s development over the last year. Danelle has shown a commitment to assisting members of our society who lack access to justice. She is zealous in her efforts to gain a greater understanding of South Africans of all backgrounds and seeks to use her academic background to ensure a just and equal society for all. When reflecting on Danelle’s conduct on our program it is her tenacity and curiosity that stands out the most. Her plans to experience as much as she can and to engage fully in the leadership development curriculum were not even derailed when she suffered an injury during our program. She also showed her skills as a pragmatic and goal-oriented leader during the SAWIP team’s community engagement project. Danelle is not only devoted to her own personal development but has shown her passion for empowering others. Working with a team from different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds for a long period of time requires maturity an open mind and self-awareness. In this regard Danelle has shown immense growth. She is able step outside her comfort zone and can interact with others with empathy. While she has many strengths she is also aware of the areas in which she needs improvement and I know that she will seek opportunities to enhance her skills. I have great confidence in recommending Danelle for any position she believes would fit her skill set and career goals. She is a self-starter who never shies away from hard work and I know that she will make the most of any opportunity. Please do not hesitate to contact me at cheri@sawip.org or on +1-571-275-8970 should you have any questions. Best wishes

RE: TESTIMONIAL FOR: Duduzile Ngubane

IDENTITY NUMBER: 9508130850087

STUDENT NUMBER: 213518410

It is with great pleasure and honour to write this reference for Ms Ngubane. I taught Ms

Ngubane in 2015-2017 modules; Constitutional Law Human Rights Law and Clinical Law.

Thus this letter testifies to her legal education that occurred during this lecture period.

During this period Ms Ngubane demonstrated research skills that are well developed and

concise to the subject matter concerned as evidenced by her obtaining 96% in Accounting for

Legal Practice. Further she evidenced a developing skill in the analysis and critical study of

legal questions and theories.

She is a diligent hard-working and principled individual. She is cooperative willing to learn

and patient in the execution of her tasks. She is articulate in her arguments and demonstrates

an ability to research construct structure and argue precisely. I believe that she has a heart of

an excellent Lawyer. She is a member of the Back Lawyers Association and Heading a

Department of Education at Twelve Apostolic Church in Christ where she engages in

programmes geared towards the education of young people.

Being a lawyer takes discipline critical thinking research and impeachable technical skills

therefore I know that Ms Ngubane has what it takes to meaningfully contribute to the legal

profession in general. Moreover I can attest that she is willing to learn and go beyond the

minimum requirements.

My name is Duduzile Ngubane I am an LLB final year student at the University of

KwaZulu Natal Howard College. It is with great enthusiasm that I am writing to apply for

the Graduate Programme Position at RMB Group.

After learning more about your work I believe that RMB Group would be an ideal place

for me to work in because it builds on my long-time commitment of contributing to the

usage of financial expertise to do what is best for the communities individuals and

families. I hope to further RMB’s mission through my dedication and hard work. RMB’s

excellent work over the past years appeals greatly to my passion for assisting the

people. It would be an honor to work for one of South Africa’s largest financial service

as it will strengthen my values of strong work ethic and cultural vibrancy. I commit

myself in developing more knowledge and that of RMB. I further commit myself to living

out RMB Group’s core values of accountability professionalism work ethics integrity

respect and openness.

I am young energetic committed and skilled individual who is reliable and accountable.

Working closely with the public in a fast-paced environment at Ntuzuma Magistrate

Court equipped me with the ability to deal with clients in a friendly and empathetic

manner. It also enhanced my communication skills both written and verbal. I therefore

consider communication skills to be my greatest strengths and listening attentively to

the need of the clients and making sure they receive good customer service. I pose

analytical skills to analyze and solve problems while paying great attention to details.

Being a member of Black Lawyers Association has taught me to function well as part of

a team while being individually accountable and reliable.

I am a community minded citizen who wants to make a positive change in the world. I

believe my hard work and motivation would be an asset to RMB in the work they do for

the community and their commitment for making the world a safer and better place to

live. The mission of RMB is exactly the type of environment in which I hope to work in.

I am fluent in English and IsiZulu. I am willing to relocate to any area near any offices I

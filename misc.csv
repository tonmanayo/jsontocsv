My major interest is music. I am an avid guitar player and have also composed a few songs of my own.

I enjoy a round of golf and I made a hole-in-one when I was 13 years old on the 13th hole at Lost City Golf Course.

I also enjoy the odd extreme sport such as Warrior racing Bungee Jumping and have jumped the world’s highest bungee jump at Bloukrans bridge (216 metres.)

I successfully completed the BMW Driving Experience Advanced High Performance Performance Course on 10 April 2015.

I enjoy camping and travelling. I enjoy the outdoor life and have travelled to Southern African countries such as Botswana Namibia Zimbabwe Mozambique Lesotho and Swaziland.

I am part of a close-knit family with me being one of triplets.

 – Cars boats family and friends and food. I have a desire to learn new skills and knowledge and have a large interest in learning a new language

Personal Attributes – I see myself as hard working motivated and persevering. I love to learn new things that develop myself as an individual and that I can use what I have learnt to help others. I believe that there are always new things to learn in such a dynamic environment and that I can use new knowledge to improve and develop my understanding of business.

OTHER – Since 2016 I have been a member of the FIDS organisations where I have attended corporate presentations to help build my knowledge and better prepare myself for the corporate world. I have met with Alan Grey JSE CFA CIMA FPI Standard Chartered RMB

I have had a passion for Finance and business and my choice to not only do my undergraduate degree in finance but a different degree for my postgraduate in Business Sciences (Management) I believe could be of great use to myself and your organisation as it gives me a broader business understanding which will allow me to contribute more and with a wider understanding than had I focused on one degree field. I plan on doing my CFA and would like to achieve my charter holder for this.
